Multithreading : 
Life Cycle of Thread:
        new-> Active->Blocked/waiting->Timing Waiting->Terminiated
      > When a thread invokes the start() method, it moves from the new state to the active state.
      > active state contains two states : Runnable And Running
How To Create Thread:
Two Ways:
1. Runnable Interface:
     > only one method Run()
     > can not use start method directly ,Need to create obj of thread class
2. Thread Class:
     > It has Start()
     > Implements Runnable interface so it has run()
     > directly use start()
Joining Thread:
> Join() provided by java.
> method which allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution.
>the current thread stops its execution and the thread goes into the wait state.
